## üîç Types of Vulnerabilities Detected

BugBuster identifies and analyzes a comprehensive range of security vulnerabilities across multiple categories:

### Interpreter Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities that arise when code is executed by various interpreters without proper validation or sanitization:
- **SQL Injection**: Malicious SQL code executed by database interpreters, allowing unauthorized database access or manipulation
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Malicious scripts executed by browser JavaScript interpreters, enabling session hijacking or data theft
- **Shell Injection**: Dangerous commands executed by operating system shell interpreters, potentially leading to system compromise
- **Command Injection**: Arbitrary commands executed through system calls or shell interfaces
- **Template Injection**: Code executed through template engines, potentially exposing sensitive data or server control

### Cross-Language Security Gaps
Security issues that emerge at the boundaries between different programming languages or systems:
- **Inconsistent Sanitization**: Different languages applying varying levels of input validation, creating exploitable gaps
- **Encoding Mismatches**: Character encoding differences between languages leading to bypass vulnerabilities
- **API Security Flaws**: Insecure data handling when transitioning between APIs written in different languages
- **Unsafe Boundary Transitions**: Data type conversions or serialization/deserialization flaws at language boundaries
- **Escaping Inconsistencies**: Different escaping mechanisms across languages allowing injection attacks

### Input Validation Inconsistencies
Flaws arising from inadequate or inconsistent validation of user inputs:
- **Validation Bypasses**: Different validation rules in different application layers allowing malicious input to pass through
- **Type Confusion**: Exploiting differences in how languages handle data types
- **Business Logic Flaws**: Inconsistent validation allowing unauthorized operations
- **Path Traversal**: Inadequate validation of file paths enabling unauthorized file access
- **LDAP/XML/NoSQL Injection**: Language-specific injection vulnerabilities due to inconsistent input handling

### Detection Methods
BugBuster employs multiple detection methodologies to ensure comprehensive coverage:
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Analyzing source code without execution to identify vulnerabilities
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Testing running applications to discover runtime vulnerabilities
- **Fuzz Testing**: Automated input of malformed or unexpected data to discover edge cases
- **API Security Testing**: Specialized analysis of API endpoints and data flows
- **Dependency Scanning**: Identifying known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies
- **Code Audit**: Manual and automated review of code quality and security practices
- **Container Scanning**: Analysis of containerized applications for security misconfigurations
- **Monitoring Methods**: Runtime detection and alerting of suspicious activities and patterns
